Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 2

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during circuit set up `Env1'.
     Several fundamental frequencies are set to the same value 2.412 GHz. A simpler frequency grid is advised and would be faster.
